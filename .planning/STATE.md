## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01 | Use @click.prevent with custom toggleMark handler for checkboxes | Reka UI's @update:checked wasn't firing consistently; manual control ensures reliable state management |
| 01 | Simplify control buttons to Select all/Clear all only | "Deselect all" and "Clear all" are functionally identical; removed redundancy for cleaner UX |
| 01 | Implement empty state early | Prepare component for real-world usage even though EMPTY-01 is Phase 3 requirement |
